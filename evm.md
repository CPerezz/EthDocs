# EVM

## EVM seen with big perspective.
Before diving into understanding how EVM works and seeing it working via code examples, letâ€™s see where EVM fits in the Ethereum and what are its components.

The below diagram shows where EVM fits into Ethereum.

The next one, shows the EVM architecture as a simple stack-based arch.

Finally we can see here the EVM execution model.

## Ethereum Contracts.

Smart contracts **are just computer programs**, and we can say that Ethereum contracts are smart contracts **that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine**. The EVM is the sandboxed runtime and a completely isolated environment for smart contracts in Ethereum. This means that **every smart contract running inside the EVM has no access to the network, file system, or other processes running on the computer hosting the VM**.

As we already know, there are two kinds of accounts: contracts and external accounts. Every account is identified by an address, and all accounts share the same address space. The EVM handles addresses of 160-bit length.

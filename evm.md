# EVM

## EVM seen with big perspective.
Before diving into understanding how EVM works and seeing it working via code examples, letâ€™s see where EVM fits in the Ethereum and what are its components.

The below diagram shows where EVM fits into Ethereum.

The next one, shows the EVM architecture as a simple stack-based arch.

Finally we can see here the EVM execution model.

## Ethereum Contracts.

Smart contracts **are just computer programs**, and we can say that Ethereum contracts are smart contracts **that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine**. The EVM is the sandboxed runtime and a completely isolated environment for smart contracts in Ethereum. This means that **every smart contract running inside the EVM has no access to the network, file system, or other processes running on the computer hosting the VM**.

As we already know, there are two kinds of accounts: contracts and external accounts. Every account is identified by an address, and all accounts share the same address space. The EVM handles addresses of 160-bit length.

Every account consists of a balance, a nonce, bytecode, and stored data (storage). However, there are some differences between these two kinds of accounts:
- Code and storage of external owned accounts are empty while contract ones store their bytecode and the merkle root hash of the entire state tree (WHY the root?).

- EOA are controlled by a Sk (Secret/Private key) while contracts are controlled by it's code, executed by the EVM.

The first thing that happens when a new contract is deployed to the Ethereum blockchain is that its account is created.
